//! Typed wire-protocol operation bodies (everything after the 16-byte header).
//!
//! The MongoDB wire protocol uses a small set of opcodes. Each opcode has its
//! own body layout, modelled here:
//!
//! * [`op_msg::OperationMessage`] — modern OP_MSG; the only opcode used for
//!   user-visible commands on current servers.
//! * [`op_query::OperationQuery`] — legacy OP_QUERY; still used for the
//!   initial `isMaster` / `hello` handshake.
//! * [`op_reply::OperationReply`] — legacy OP_REPLY; paired with OP_QUERY.
//!
//! The [`Operation`] enum is the discriminated union the rest of the crate
//! uses to talk about an operation body abstractly.
